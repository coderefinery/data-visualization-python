# Learning how to adapt existing gallery examples

In this exercise we can try to adapt existing scripts to either **tweak how the
plot looks** or to **modify the input data**.  This is very close to real life:
there are so many options and possibilities and it is almost impossible to
remember everything so this strategy is useful to practice:
- Select an example that is close to what you have in mind
- Being able to adapt it to your needs
- Being able to search for help
- Being able to understand help request answers (not easy)

:::{challenge} Exercise Customization-1: Adapting a gallery example
**This is a great exercise which is very close to real life.**

- Browse the [Vega-Altair example gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html).
- Select one example that is close to your current/recent visualization project
  or simply interests you.
- First try to reproduce this example, as-is, in the Jupyter Notebook.
- Then try to print out the data that is used in this example just before the call of the plotting function
  to learn about its structure.
- Then try to modify the data a bit.
- If you have time, try to feed it different, simplified data.
  This will be key for adapting the examples to your projects.

After the exercises, the group can discuss their findings and it is important to
clarify questions at this point before moving on.
