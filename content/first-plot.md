# Generating our first plot

```{objectives}
- Be able to create simple plots with Matplotlib and tweak them
- Be able to adapt gallery examples (more about this tomorrow)
- Know how to look for help
- Know that other tools exist
```

```{instructor-note}
- 20 min talking/type-along
- 15 min exercise
```

## Repeatability/reproducibility

From [Claus O. Wilke: "Fundamentals of Data Visualization"](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/):

> *One thing I have learned over the years is that automation is your friend. I
> think figures should be autogenerated as part of the data analysis pipeline
> (which should also be automated), and they should come out of the pipeline
> ready to be sent to the printer, no manual post-processing needed.*

- **Try to minimize manual post-processing**. This could bite you when you need to regenerate 50
  figures one day before submission deadline or regenerate a set of figures
  after the person who created them left the group.
- There is not the one perfect language and **not the one perfect library** for everything.
- Within Python, many libraries exist:
  - [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html):
    declarative visualization, statistics built in
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html):
    probably the most standard and most widely used
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html):
    high-level interface to Matplotlib, statistical functions built in
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/):
    interactive graphs
  - [Bokeh](https://demo.bokeh.org/):
    also here good for interactivity
  - [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/):
    implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
  - [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/):
    R users will be more at home
  - [PyNGL](https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Examples/gallery.shtml):
    used in the weather forecast community
  - [K3D](https://k3d-jupyter.org/gallery/index.html):
    Jupyter notebook extension for 3D visualization
  - ...
- Two main families of libraries: procedural (e.g. Matplotlib) and declarative.


## Why are we starting with [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)?

```{discussion} Why these colors?
This qualitative color palette is opimized for all color-vision
deficiencies, see <https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/color-pitfalls.html> and
[Okabe, M., and K. Ito. 2008. "Color Universal Design (CUD):
How to Make Figures and Presentations That Are Friendly to Colorblind People."](http://jfly.iam.u-tokyo.ac.jp/color/).
```

---

```{keypoints}
- Avoid manual post-processing, try to script everything.
- Browse a number of example galleries to help you choose the library that fits best your work/style.
- Think about color-vision deficiencies when choosing colors. Use existing solutions for this problem.
- Figures for presentation slides and figures for manuscripts have different requirements. More about that later.
