## Repeatability/reproducibility

From [Claus O. Wilke: "Fundamentals of Data Visualization"](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/):

> *One thing I have learned over the years is that automation is your friend. I
> think figures should be autogenerated as part of the data analysis pipeline
> (which should also be automated), and they should come out of the pipeline
> ready to be sent to the printer, no manual post-processing needed.*

- **Try to minimize manual post-processing**. This could bite you when you need to regenerate 50
  figures one day before submission deadline or regenerate a set of figures
  after the person who created them left the group.
- There is not the one perfect language and **not the one perfect library** for everything.
- Within Python, many libraries exist:
  - [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html):
    declarative visualization, statistics built in
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/gallery/index.html):
    probably the most standard and most widely used
  - [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/index.html):
    high-level interface to Matplotlib, statistical functions built in
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/):
    interactive graphs
  - [Bokeh](https://demo.bokeh.org/):
    also here good for interactivity
  - [plotnine](https://plotnine.readthedocs.io/):
    implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python, it is based on [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
  - [ggplot](https://yhat.github.io/ggpy/):
    R users will be more at home
  - [PyNGL](https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Examples/gallery.shtml):
    used in the weather forecast community
  - [K3D](https://k3d-jupyter.org/gallery/index.html):
    Jupyter Notebook extension for 3D visualization
  - ...
- Two main families of libraries: procedural (e.g. Matplotlib) and declarative.


## Why are we starting with [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/)?

- Concise and powerful
- Allows us to focus on the data visualization part and get started without too much Python knowledge
- The way it combines visual channels with data columns can feel intuitive
- Easy to change figures
- Good documentation
- Open source
- Makes it easy to save figures in a number of formats
- Interfaces very nicely with [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- Easy to save interactive visualizations to be used in websites


## Loading and plotting a dataset

In this lesson will work with one of the
[Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/) datasets.

Let us together read and plot the data and then we explain what is happening
and we will improve the figure together.  First we read and inspect the data:
```python
# import necessary libraries
import altair as alt
import pandas as pd

# read the data
url_prefix = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/plotly/datasets/master/"
data = pd.read_csv(url_prefix + "gapminder_with_codes.csv")

# print overview of the dataset
data
```

With very few lines we can get the first plot:
```python
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
)
```

```{figure} img/first-plot/all-data.svg
:alt: First raw plot with all countries and all years.

First raw plot with all countries and all years.
```

Observe how we connect (encode) **visual channels** to data columns:
- x-coordinate with "gdpPercap"
- y-coordinate with "lifeExp"

The following code would have the same effect but the above version might be
easier to read:
```python
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp")
```

```{discussion} Let us pause and explain the code
- `alt` is a short-hand for `altair` which we imported on top of the notebook
- `Chart()` is a function defined inside `altair` which takes the data as argument
- `mark_point()` is a function that produces scatter plots
- `encode()` is a function which encodes data columns to visual channels
```


## Filtering data directly in [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io)

In [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) we can chain functions. Let us
add two more:
```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 4
---
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
).transform_filter(alt.datum.year == 2007).interactive()
```

```{figure} img/first-plot/only-2007.svg
:alt: Now we only keep the year 2007.

Now we only keep the year 2007.
```


## Using color as additional channel

A very neat feature of [Vega-Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io) is that it
is easy to add and modify visual channels. Let us try to add one more so that
we do something with the "continent" data column:
```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 4
---
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
    color="continent",
).transform_filter(alt.datum.year == 2007).interactive()
```

```{figure} img/first-plot/color.svg
:alt: Using different colors for different continents.

Using different colors for different continents.
```


## Changing to log scale

For this data set we will get a better insight when switching the x-axis from
linear to log scale (we changed two lines to show both the "method syntax" and
the "attribute syntax"):
```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 2-3
---
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x=alt.X("gdpPercap").scale(type="log"),
    y=alt.Y("lifeExp"),
    color="continent",
).transform_filter(alt.datum.year == 2007).interactive()
```

```{figure} img/first-plot/log-scale.svg
:alt: Changing the x axis to log scale.

Changing the x axis to log scale.
```


## Improving axis titles

```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 2-3
---
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x=alt.X("gdpPercap").scale(type="log").title("GDP per capita (PPP dollars)"),
    y=alt.Y("lifeExp").title("Life expectancy (years)"),
    color="continent",
).transform_filter(alt.datum.year == 2007).interactive()
```

```{figure} img/first-plot/axis-titles.svg
:alt: Improving the axis titles.

Improving the axis titles.
```


## Faceted charts

To see what faceted charts are and how easy it is to do this, add the following
line:
```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 5
---
alt.Chart(data).mark_point().encode(
    x=alt.X("gdpPercap").scale(type="log").title("GDP per capita (PPP dollars)"),
    y=alt.Y("lifeExp").title("Life expectancy (years)"),
    color="continent",
    row="continent",
).transform_filter(alt.datum.year == 2007).interactive()
```

Guess what happens when you change `row="continent"` to `column="continent"`?


## Changing from points to circles

Let us add one more visual channel, mapping size of the circle to the
population size of a country:
```{code-block} python
---
emphasize-lines: 1,5
---
alt.Chart(data).mark_circle().encode(
    x=alt.X("gdpPercap").scale(type="log").title("GDP per capita (PPP dollars)"),
    y=alt.Y("lifeExp").title("Life expectancy (years)"),
    color="continent",
    size="pop",
).transform_filter(alt.datum.year == 2007).interactive()
```

```{figure} img/first-plot/population-size.svg
:alt: Circle sizes are proportional to population sizes.

Circle sizes are proportional to population sizes.
```

---

```{discussion} Where to go from here?
In few steps and few lines of code we have achieved a lot!

These plots are perhaps not publication quality yet but we will learn how to
customize and improve in {ref}`customizing-plots`.
```

```{keypoints}
- Avoid manual post-processing, try to script all steps.
- Browse a number of example galleries to help you choose the library that fits best your work/style.
- Figures for presentation slides and figures for manuscripts have different
  requirements. More about that later.
```
