## Motivation

[Hadley Wickham: Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf)

Explain what it is and motivate why it can be a useful format.

As a motivation we will try to expand the plotting from previous episode. It
will require adapting the scripts. Then we will discuss how convenient it would
be to extend plotting without modifying scripts a lot.


## Exercises

```{challenge} Exercise: convert from "wide" to "long" format (15 min)
- We will see 2-3 examples and the goal will be to suggest how to express them
  in tidy format.
